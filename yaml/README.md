## How To Run a Batch Job
* Use the provided `batch_job.yaml` to run a batch job. You just need to modify `POD_NAME`, `EXP_NAME` and `INSTANCE_NAME` in the yaml file for different experiments.
* If `run_exp.sh` is not present in the path `\ceph\run_exp.sh` in the pod, copy it first to the desired path.
